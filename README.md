I have split three parts of the homework into three respective directories. For each scheme, I included either
a proof from the system-on TPTP in a .txt file, or a respective model generated via Paradox also in a .txt file. I haven't included proofs from my desktop just because I ran into some issues with Paradox. I would be happy, however, to send through results from my PC, if there was an issue.

In general, In the first part I found all proofs for all sections apart from the last one and in the second part, I found proofs only for the first and third ones. All the other ones have their models generated via Paradox included.

Subsequently, In the third section I transformed axioms from each of the first two parts into conjectures and in case they weren't the same as axioms in the second model, I tested if I could see a proof of their existence. I came to the conclusion that whilst HI system could in its entirety exist in HC system, the reverse doesn't apply. 

I have also enclosed a word document named homework3.doc, which includes all code used together.
